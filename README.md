# WiFi Project

A project that was made in OOP course, for understanding and learning OOP. The Project was made by Yonatan Rofsov and Shiran Awasker.

# About the Project

The project lets you create a Date-base with WiFi Access points and write the DB to CSV and KML. The initial Date-base we gathered from an Androind app which collects and reads WiFi signals. Before writing the Date-base you can filter it by location, time or device and you can put it through two algorithms which will provide you missing location, or a location of the wifi access point. 

## Getting Started and Installing

You can get the project in two options, one is Java files and the second one is a full jar with no dependence on other tools 

Just download the one you need, and a wayyyy we goooo

if you need the jar, simply go to the build directory, and just double click it, its Gradle wrapped so you wont need to install any further applications.

If you are going to work and re-modify the project, change all the paths of the readers and writers inside the classes. 
For further information you can check our UML Diagram and Java Docs for this project.
